# üè¶ Banking Management System (Python + SQLite + Tkinter)

A desktop-based banking system developed in **Python**, with **SQLite** as the database and **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI). The system is designed to simulate real-world banking operations and provide secure, role-based access for different categories of users. This project aims to demonstrate full-stack software development skills in a desktop environment, including database modeling, UI design, and secure user authentication.

> üöß **Status**: Under active development ‚Äî several modules are functional, while others are being incrementally added. Expect frequent updates and structural changes.

## üéØ Project Objectives

This system is built to:
- Support multiple **user roles** with distinct permissions
- Perform basic and advanced **banking operations**
- Simulate a **real-world** banking workflow (from account creation to audits)
- Apply **OOP principles** for clean, scalable code
- Offer a responsive and user-friendly **Tkinter GUI**
